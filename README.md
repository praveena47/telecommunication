# project overview
 Telecommunications company is facing a significant issue with customer churn, resulting in substantial revenue loss. The objective is to analyze the dataset, which includes customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status, to identify key factors causing churn and develop strategies for retention
 we will leverage Power BI's SQL capabilities to connect to the telecommunications company's database, extract the customer churn dataset, and perform data analysis, transformation, and visualization to identify primary factors influencing churn, differentiate demographic or behavioral characteristics of churned customers, assess the impact of services and contract terms, and build a predictive model for accurate churn forecasting. The insights derived from this analysis will inform data-driven strategies for reducing churn and increasing customer retention, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and revenue retention.".
